# no_lib_neural
This code implements a basic neural network from scratch to classify handwritten digits using the TinyMNIST dataset. It loads and normalizes data, defines activation functions (ReLU, softmax, tanh), and performs forward and backward propagation. The model is trained via gradient descent, optimizing weights to minimize classification error.
